Hi, my name is Matthew Miley, GIS Director at [Technical Assurance, Inc.](https://www.TechnicalAssurance.com) â€“ a building enclosure consulting firm.

I'm interested in programming in JavaScript (node.js), C#, Python, sql, gis, etc... In real life I like mountain biking, snowboarding, and podcasts.

I live on the East side of Cleveland Ohio with my beautiful wife and two kids.
